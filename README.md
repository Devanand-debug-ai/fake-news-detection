# Fake News Detection

## Overview
Fake News Detection is a machine learning–based project that classifies news articles as **Fake** or **Real** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The system analyzes textual data and predicts the authenticity of news content, helping to reduce the spread of misinformation.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- TF-IDF Vectorizer
- Flask
- Pickle (.pkl)


## Working
1. The user provides a news article or text as input.
2. The input text is transformed using the TF-IDF vectorizer.
3. The trained machine learning model analyzes the transformed data.
4. The system predicts whether the news is **Fake** or **Real**.


## Features
- Detects fake and real news articles
- Uses NLP and machine learning techniques
- Fast prediction using a pre-trained model
- Simple Flask-based backend

## Future Scope
- Integrate a web-based frontend
- Improve accuracy using deep learning models
- Add batch prediction support
- Display prediction confidence levels
